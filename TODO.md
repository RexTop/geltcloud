# TODO LIST

- Use the onSubmit event in the modal dialog to allow pressing [Enter] to save changes.
- Opt-in to use subscriptions
- Sometimes subscriptions expire. In such cases, the UI does not updates when update/delete/create operations are called.
- Add UI validations. When an item is updated with an empty string currently only a unhelpful error is shown. Enforce users to complete all string fields when updating of creating cash accounts and credit cards.
- Be able to edit and see `tags` of operations

# Release TODO:

- Update user name in sidebar
- Check that dates are saved in UTC format but displayed in local time.
